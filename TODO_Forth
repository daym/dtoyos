Set up the stacks.
	data stack
	return stack
	word stack [?] or dictionary
		flags: immediate, word IMMEDIATE; compile-time
		lenword, word
		previous ptr
		code
		arguments, if any [opcodes, words, ...]
Implement Forth REPL in Assembly
	read words
	show top of data stack
	sometimes show top of return stack
Builtin words:
	dup
	read-word
	print-word
	+
	-
	*
	<
	[
	]
	div
	if
	else
	: word # compiles until ";" (from input device)
	:NONAME for anon functions
	EXECUTE
	POSTPONE (from input device)
	' (from input device)
	( (from input device)
	@
	IMMEDIATE
	LITERAL
	STATE
	VARIABLE
	CONSTANT
	CREATE
data tagging:
	data is either address or immediate.
	If immediate, bottom 2 bits are 0.
	Otherwise, contains type code of common types (for speed). If not common, contains 11b.
Maybe include an assembler!
