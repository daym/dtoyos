For drives bigger than 8GB, generally the CHS fields are set to Cylinder = 1023, Head = 254 or 255, Sector = 63 -- which is considered an invalid setting.
system id 0 = unused.

so we have:
	0x80 if bootable partition,
	0xFF, # starting head
	0xFF, # starting sector and starting cylinder.
	0xFF, # starting cylinder.
	0xTODO, # system ID
	0xFF, # ending head
	0xFF, # ending sector and ending cylinder.
	0xFF, # ending cylinder.
	XXX, # 4 Byte starting sector.
	XXX, # 4 Byte length in sectors.

DOS MBR does:
    relocate itself to 0x0000:0x0600
    examine the byte at offset 0x1be, 0x1ce, 0x1de, and 0x1ee to determine the active partition
    load only the first sector of the active partition (which is expected to contain a DOS bootsector) to 0x0000:0x7c00 (hence the previous relocation)
    set SI
    jump to 0x7c00 -- transferring control to the DOS bootsector.
--
	# better to load 8 sectors, if possible. Or 1218 sectors if possible (~ 609 KiB) [that's how much space there is in RAM at 0x7C00]
