int 18h if you can't boot. Or RETF.
Partitioning so that there's a separate (< 32 kB) kernel partition. Make the loader load from there. There's also a bootsector there - of sorts.
Maybe in the future - because of backwards compatibility - move ourselves away from 0x7C00 in order to free it for the secondary boot code.
Maybe it's possible to just change CS and leave the rest as-is. Probably unsafe.
